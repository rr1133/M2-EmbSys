# Microwave Oven

## Introduction 

Microwave oven, also called electronic oven, appliance that cooks food by means of high-frequency electromagnetic waves called microwaves. A microwave oven is a relatively small, boxlike oven that raises the temperature of food by subjecting it to a high-frequency electromagnetic field. The microwaves are absorbed by water, fats, sugars, and certain other molecules, whose consequent vibrations produce heat.
The heating thus occurs inside the food, without warming the surrounding air; this greatly reduces cooking time, and baking and other cooking tasks that require hours in a conventional oven can be completed in minutes in a microwave oven. Microwave ovens generate radiation at a frequency of about 2,450 megahertz by means of a magnetron, which is a kind of electron tube.

## Design Detail


### i) High Voltage Transformer:- 
The high voltage transformer is essentially employed into home appliances such as a microwave oven which generates microwave to cook the foods, or the like, in order to supply the high voltage thereto.

### ii) Magnetron Tube:-
Magnetron is a type of vacuum tube which generates signals of the microwave frequency range, with the help of interactions of a magnetic field and electron beams.
Magnetron tube consumes high-power, and its frequency depends on the physical dimension of the tubesâ€™ cavities. There is a primary difference between a Magnetron and other types of Microwave Tubes. A magnetron works only as an Oscillator but not an amplifier, but a Klystron (a Microwave Tube) can work as an amplifier and as an Oscillator.

### iii) Wave Guide:-
waveguides are used at frequencies in the microwave range. At microwave frequencies ( above 1GHz to 100 GHz ) the losses in the two line transmission system will be very high and hence it cannot be used at those frequencies . hence microwave signals are propagated through the waveguides in order to minimize the losses.

### iv) Cooking Cavity of Oven:-
The "cooking cavity" of a typical microwave oven. This strong metal box stops harmful microwaves from escaping. The microwaves are generated by a device called a magnetron, which is behind the perforated metal grid on the right hand side (just behind the lamp that illuminates the oven inside).

### v) Over Heating Sensing Circuit:-
If the Microwave is overheating and shutting itself down, this is caused by high voltage parts inside the unit getting too hot the leading the thermal cut-out switch to be activated as a safe feature to prevent further overheating. After the unit has cooled down the thermal cut-out switch will reset automatically and the Microwave will proceed to function as per normal.

### vi) Turntable Control and Drives:-
A turntable motor drive circuit of a microwave oven is provided to drive a turntable motor by a low voltage by transforming a commercial AC power source into any level of a low level voltage and by applying the transformed low level voltage to the turntable motor.

### vii) Interlock and Protection Circuit:-
It is conventional for microwave ovens to have oven door interlock switch systems designed to stop or interrupt the flow of electrical energy to the magnetron tube upon the opening of the oven door.

### viii) Timer:-
Timer role is simply set the start time, end time or duration of the cooking process and everything will be ready when you want it. The cooking process ends automatically when the programmed cooking duration comes to an end.

### ix) Door Sensor:-
A door sensor is a simple on/off mechanism that prohibits the microwave from operating when the door is open. Microwave door switches are only an inch long. Most are black in color and all have metal prongs, called terminals, extending out from the body of the switch.

### x) System Control:-
A control circuit for a microwave oven is disclosed which functions to automatically control the running time of the microwave generator to enable it to run continuously, during its cooking cycle, or intermittently, during its defrosting cycle. The control circuit includes a timer control switch operatively coupled to a timer motor. The timer control switch functions to control the current flow from the source of electrical power to the microwave generator. The circuit also includes a defrost control switch which functions to cyclically open and close a series current path to the microwave generator. 

### xi) Display:-
The microwave display is an important part of the appliance. The display is used to confirm that your button-press commands have entered. It counts down the time, displays power level, and shows you which preset you've selected. In many households, it's also the primary visible clock.

### xii) Triggering:-
An electronic triggering circuit is disclosed for developing a periodic control signal having a variable duty cycle. The periodic control signal is developed in synchronization with an applied alternating line voltage and is utilized for rendering a semiconductor switch conductive and nonconductive in timed relationship to the negative half cycle of the applied line voltage. The semiconductor switch is interposed between the line voltage and a load, which may be the power supply for a microwave oven, such that as the duty cycle of the control signal is varied the microwave power supplied to the oven is also varied. 

### xiii) Switching Element and Control:-
Switching Elements mainly work on feedback loop system, a feedback temperature controller for controlling product temperatures during microwave. heating by cycling the magnetron on and off. The temperature controller consists of. a fiber optic temperature sensing system, a computer, an optocoupler, and a mechanical. relay.
