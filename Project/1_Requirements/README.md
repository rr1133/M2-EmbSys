# Ultrasonic Radar System
 ## Introduction
 
 ULTRASONIC RADAR is an object for identification framework in which utilizations of radio waves are to decide the reach, elevation, heading, or speed of object.
Ultrasonic Radar frameworks are utilized for aviation authority at air terminals, and long range observation and early-cautioning frameworks. A radar framework is the core of
a rocket direction framework. Radar was furtively evolved by a few countries previously and during World War II.The term RADAR itself, not the real
advancement, was begat in 1940 by the United States Navy as an abbreviation for Radio Detection and Ranging. The term radar has since entered English
what's more different dialects; as a typical thing radar loses all capitalization. The utilization of such innovation has been seen as of late in oneself leaving vehicle frameworks sent off by Audi, Ford, and, surprisingly, the forthcoming driverless vehicles by Google, Tesla,Volvo and BMW. The task made by us can be utilized in any frameworks the client might need to involve like in a vehicle, a bike or whatever else. The utilization of Arduino in the task gives significantly greater adaptability of use of the
use of Arduino in the project provides even more aforementioned module according to the requirements.
